# RPAutoBuild
RPAutoBuilder - The C++ Builder! (a make alternitive)

## RPAutoBuild
RPAutoBuild is a C++ alternitive to make (and I guess Cmake).<br>RPAutoBuild works by cloning a git repo (and submodules), reading the rpauto.build file and building targets according to the config. Operating systems can be freely selected and will automatically be defined in the source files though `-D{OS}` (This feature require a compiler for the target OS)<br>
